# Vanilla JS Template
This is used as a starter package for creating a ES6 Vanilla Javascript project with webpack!
It also has a SCSS pre-compiler set up!

## What's Under the Hood?
- `JQuery`: For DOM manipulation is included by default
- `lodash`: Not included by default but very useful for more intensive projects
- `Material Design Light`: `index.html` contains links to style sheets for using MDL with a default colour theme

## Upcoming Features
- Add the ability to create templated components
- Linting
- Basic unit testing suite
